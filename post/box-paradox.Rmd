# The paradox

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_box_paradox

# Analytical solution in Python

```{python code, eval=F}
import random
import numpy as np


# 0 represents a silver coin, 1 a gold coin
b1 = [1,1]
b2 = [0,0]
b3 = [1,0]

boxes = np.matrix([b1,b2,b3])

rounds = 100000
first = []
second = []

for r in range(rounds):
    box = random.randint(0,2)
    coin1 = random.randint(0,1)
    coin2 = abs(coin1 - 1)
    
    first.append(boxes[box,coin1])
    second.append(boxes[box, coin2])
    
print(first)
print(second)

first = np.array(first)
second = np.array(second)

indexes = np.where(first == 1)

np.mean(second[indexes])
```

Turns out to be around 0.66.
