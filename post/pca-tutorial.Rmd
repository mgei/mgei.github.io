I perform a PCA on a set of six MSCI indices. First, I go download the data and import it into R with readxl. Then I look at the data and the returns with some very basic techniques like plotting the performance with ggplot and tidyquant. Later I perform a PCA and also apply a varimax transformation on the loadings (the eigenvectors). Lastly, I look at how an equal-weighted portfolio performed versus a portfolio with components selected based on the PCA/varimax results. It's not fully as desired but (we want higher Sharpe ratio of course), but interesting nevertheless.
