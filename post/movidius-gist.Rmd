## Movidius and Intel Neural Compute Stick 2

> The new, improved Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 (Intel® NCS 2) features Intel’s latest high-performance vision processing unit: the Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ X VPU. With more compute cores and a dedicated hardware accelerator for deep neural network inference, the Intel® NCS 2 delivers up to eight times the performance boost compared to the previous generation Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick (NCS).
— [Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/neural-compute-stick)

The sticks allow for deploying AI on the edge, for example on an Raspberry. Version one of the stick is [discontinued](https://software.intel.com/en-us/movidius-ncs), and followed by the Neural Compute Stick 2. Currently it can be purchased for around 100 USD.

Intel offers the [OpenVino toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) to transfer models e.g. from Tensorflow (and some other deep learning frameworks) to run on the sticks.
