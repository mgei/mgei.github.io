## R / Blogdown / Hugo

The website you are looking at is made with R and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). Blogdown allows to use the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with R Markdown documents (\*.Rmd) instead of only pure markdown (\*.md). So one can easily integrate R code which is rendered like a HTML R Markdown document.

The theme used here is [Minimo](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo).

![*Screenshot of the Minimo theme with default colors*](/images/post/minimo-screenshot.png)

```{r setupcache, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = T)
```

## Github pages

This website hosted on Github. It's open source, the code is available [here](https://github.com/mgei/gh-page).

When building the site in R with `blogdown::build_site()`, the web files go into the *public* folder. Personal Github pages seem not to allow to redirect the web directory to another folder, even though suggested so [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Therefore, I have a second repository ([mgei/mgei.github.io](https://github.com/mgei/mgei.github.io)) that is to publish the site.

## Creation

The Minimo theme is fairly simple. To note is that there is a main menu on top (which here is deactivated[^de]) and a sidebar menu.

Sites, posts etc. go into the *content* directory. Note that for showing up in the relevant menu the YAML is to indicate so, e.g.

```
---
title: About
menu:
  main:
  sidebar:
    identifier: about
weight: 4
type: page
---
```

I keep posts in the post directory. Here it's TOML ([TOML vs YAML](https://gist.github.com/oconnor663/9aeb4ed56394cb013a20)) because that's how the samle post was, so I kept it, e.g. for this post:

```
---
slug: "github-page"
date: "2019-05-09"
draft: false
title: "How I made this Github page"
tags: ["github", "page", "hugo", "blogdown", "R"]
authors: [mgei]
---
```

For a new post simply copy an existing one and go from there.

The authors are defined in *data/authors/*.

Widgets such as search came with the theme. The config is in *data/config/widgets.toml*.

The relevant theme folder can be replaced with newer versions ([update guide](https://minimo.netlify.com/docs/updating/)).

The only thing edited in *theme* is *themes/minimo/layouts/partials/widgets/about.html* added `style='border-radius: 50%;'` to the img tag.

Custom CSS could be added in *static/css/custom.css*.

### Minimo syntax highlighting for R

The solution is given [here](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo/issues/100#issuecomment-368229189) by the theme creator.

Add this to *footer.html* (*themes/minimo/layouts/partials/*):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.12.0/styles/default.min.css">
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.12.0/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.12.0/languages/r.min.js"></script>
<script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>
```

More general information on syntax highlighting (that did not lead to the desired outcome for me):

* https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/5
* https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html

### Open links in new tab (target blank)

In *config.toml* there's the option to force links to open in a new tab by setting `hrefTargetBlank = true`. This works fine for \*.md files, however it does not work for \*.Rmd.

The solution which I found [here](https://yihui.name/en/2018/09/target-blank/) is to add the following to *static/js/custom.js*. This makes *external* links open in a new tab.

```js
(function() {
  var links = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
  for (var i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
    if (/^(https?:)?\/\//.test(links[i].getAttribute('href'))) {
      links[i].target = '_blank';
    }
  }
})();
```

On a more general note, in R Markdown to have a link open in a new tab one would do like this:

```md
[Google](https://www.google.com){target="_blank"}
```

### Logo

The logo in the example site from the Minimo theme is 512x512 pixels. The favicon is 16x16 and there's also a larger one with 32x32. The logo used here is generated with this code:

```{r logogen, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(10)
data <- tibble(letters1 = c("m","g", "e", "i", "."),
               letters2 = c("mgei",".", "github", ".", "io"),
               y = c(2.5, 1, 1.3, 3, 4),
               x = 1:5)
n <- 50
jitt <- tibble(y = c(rnorm(n, mean = 2.5, sd = 0.5),
                     rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 0.2),
                     rnorm(n, mean = 1.3, sd = 0.2),
                     rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5),
                     rnorm(n, mean = 4, sd = 0.5)),
               x = c(rep(1, n),
                     rep(2, n),
                     rep(3, n),
                     rep(4, n),
                     rep(5, n)),
               col = sample(c("r","b"), 5*n, replace = T))

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = letters1), alpha = 0.6) +
  # geom_text(aes(label = letters1), size = 8, alpha = 0.8, y = 4.5) +
  # geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, fullrange = T) +
  geom_jitter(data = jitt, aes(color = col), alpha = 0.2, size = 2.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = c("mgei", ".", "github", ".", "io"), breaks = 1:5) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(-0.1, 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "black")) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 6, type = "qual") +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 35),
        axis.text.y = element_blank()) -> g

g

```

To save the ggplot:

```{r saveplot, eval=F}
png("../../static/images/logo.png", width = 512, height = 512, units = "px")
g
dev.off()

png("favicon.png", width = 32, height = 32, units = "px")
g + theme(text = element_blank(),
          line = element_blank())
dev.off()
```

The latter does not work very well. Instead use ImageMagick in Ubuntu to resize:

```
convert -resize 32x32 logo.png favicon.png
```

### Caching and knitr's opts_chunk

To avoid building each page and each post from scratch each time `build_site()` is called, one can use `knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = T)`. This is to be set at the beginning, e.g. in a setup code block.

Other opts_chunk I commonly use are message, warning, or echo.

* `knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = F, warning = F)`: will avoid getting messages (for example the message upon loading the tidyverse library) or warnings.
* `echo = F`: avoids the code chunks to be shown
* `eval = F`: the code will not run, but still shown (unless it's also `echo = F`)


### Other interesting observations

* If the date of a post is in the future, it will not be included when building the site with `site_build()`. It was however included when previewing locally with `serve_site()`.

### Allow for MathJax formula to be shown correctly

Insert this on one of the main html files in themes layouts. We added it to the sidebar.html.

```{html, eval = F}
  <script src="//yihui.org/js/math-code.js"></script>
  <script async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
  </script>
```

## Build and depoly

For local preview we can do the following

```{R, eval = F}
library(blogdown)

serve_site()

# preview is on, you can also open it in the browser on localhost:4321

stop_server()
```

While editing and saving, having the site opened with `serve_site()` allows for immediate preview if you use R Studio.

To build the final version, note that you correctly specified `baseURL` in *config.toml*, run `build_site()`. This renders the site to *public*. Ideally it should be emptied first (`rm -rf public/*`).

As explained at the top, Github pages do not seem to allow for deploying personal sites in other than the top directory and other than the master git branch. Therefore, we have a separate repository for content. There might be more elegant ways to do this (githooks, branches) but it works.

*depoly.sh*

```
R -e "blogdown::build_site()"

echo Please enter commit message

read commitmessage

git add .
git commit -m "$commitmessage"
git push

cd public

git add .
git commit -m "$commitmessage"
git push

cd ..
```

## How to install Hugo on Ubuntu
