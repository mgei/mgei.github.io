 Intro In 2017 Switzerland had 18’858 free physician working in individual doctor’s offices (Aerzte mit Praxistätigkeit as opposed to doctors employed by hospitals). Also Switzerland currently has 12’967 registered lawyers.1 Relative to the number of inhabitants of nearly 8.5 million (2017), that’s on average 2.2 physicians and 1.5 lawyers per 1’000 inhabitants.
As we will see, in four cantons lawyers outnumber physicians.</description>

   I perform a PCA on a set of six MSCI indices. First, I go download the data and import it into R with readxl. Then I look at the data and the returns with some very basic techniques like plotting the performance with ggplot and tidyquant. Later I perform a PCA and also apply a varimax transformation on the loadings (the eigenvectors). Lastly, I look at how an equal-weighted portfolio performed versus a portfolio with components selected based on the PCA/varimax results.</description>
