      <description>R / Blogdown / Hugo The website you are looking at is made with R and blogdown. Blogdown allows to use the static website generator Hugo with R Markdown documents (*.Rmd) instead of only pure markdown (*.md). So one can easily integrate R code which is rendered like a HTML R Markdown document.
The theme used here is Minimo.
 Github pages This website hosted on Github. It’s open source, the code is available here.</description>
