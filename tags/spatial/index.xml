 Fake name generator Fake Name Generator allows to generate mock names/addresses. One can choose from plenty of fields to include besides names and addresses, such as date of birth, phone number, ID number, and also lon/lat coordinates.
For the following purpose we will order as many addresses as possible and should not forget to include longitude and latitude.</description>

   How to geocode locations or addresses in R with library(ggmap) in 2018/2019. Previously you could just use geocode(“New York”) to get the coordinates, but Google now required a Google Cloud Platform API key. Get the latest ggmap version from Github, and a free 12 month trial to GCP. This is how you geocode now.
We will create a leaflet map with library(leaflet) in R.</description>
