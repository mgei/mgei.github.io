      <description>What is Mintos? Mintos.com is a P2P lending platform. One can invest in loans offered by various loan organizers from various countries. Most loans are short-term and personal loans from FSU countries such as Georgia, Armenia, Russia, but also Spain or Indonesia etc. Many loans are very short term (1 month) but there’s also some with longer terms (several years). The majority of loans are denominated in Euro but the share of loans in other currencies is increasing.</description>

In my case, I struggled to even install tabulizer on Ubuntu, so I had revert to Windows.</description>

 tel.search.ch API This function allows to fetch enteries from the Swiss telephone directory tel.search.ch. It returns a tibble (dplyr).
